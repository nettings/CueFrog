#X text 34 -125 Hi! Welcome to CueFrog \, a framework to create theatre
cue players in Pd \, based on August Black's readanysf~ external.;
#X text 470 -32 |CueFrogPlayer~ 42|;
#X text 785 194 The "bangs" for Play/Pause/Stop may be replaced by
a proper state machine in the future (there is already one in the MIDI
controller). The current design is how readanysf~ does it.;
#X text 785 159 While playing \, you can "scratch" the playhead around
with the slider or the numbox. [0] returns to zero.;
#X text 785 380 The fader should feel familiar to users of analog mixing
desks. The taper makes the code a bit convoluted \, but it's worth
it. Code stolen from James McCartney (oh sweet irony) by way of the
musicdsp archive :-D;
#X text 784 449 Finally \, there are two toggles to switch to pre-fader
metering \, and to turn off the channel (click-free).;

#X text 33 150 Using the unique IDs \, it's easy to associate a MIDI
controller with your CueFrogPlayer~ decks:;

#X text 86 188 <- configuration for the first two channels;
#X text 33 417 Likewise \, you can create other controllers \, such
as a playlist manager \, a set of buttons to cut between decks \, or
a "STOP ALL" button:;

#X text 34 -88 CueFrog is being written by JÃ¶rn Nettingsmeier <nettings@stackingdwarves.net>.
I'm an inexperienced Pd programmer (in fact it's my first project)
\, so be sure to review it carefully before you use it for anything
important. I would like to hear your suggestions.;

#X text 785 259 Important note: If the play and pause buttons are flashing
like crazy and your motorfaders are rattling \, Pd has auto-connected
to all your MIDI ports and found a MIDI-Thru \, which creates a parameter
feedback loop. Make sure you disconnect all Pd MIDI connections to
MIDI Thru ports. This problem is known to happen on Linux systems using
ALSA MIDI. You can prevent Pd from auto-connecting in this way by specifcying
"-mididev 1 \, 1" on the command line.;
#X text -49 -70 v0.0.5;
#X text 463 -124 The player comes in two flavours \, a 2- and a 6-channel
one.;
#X text 463 -105 To begin \, hit the "Load_file" button and select
a suitable file in a format that readanysf~ can understand (which depends
on how it was compiled. This is Pd \, so any funky characters (specifically
\, whitespace) in filenames are a _very_ \, _very_ bad idea.;
#X text 785 10 This line will display the full path of the current
file \, or \, if used with a playlist \, an optional short name.;
#X text 785 51 This section shows read-only status information coming
from readanysf~.;
#X text 783 489 There doesn't seem to be a sane way to parameterize
the number of channels and outlets (I don't consider dynamic patching
sane). So for now there's a hardcoded variant with 6 channels for 5.1
playback. Ugly \, duplicated code. Suggestions welcome.;
#X text 785 102 You can alter the playback speed by setting a speed
coefficient \, an offset in quarter tones (from -64 to +63 \, to map
nicely to a 7bit MIDI controller) \, or with the slider. The [1] button
resets it to normal.;
#X text 33 67 CueFrog is a group of abstractions. They are written
so that you can safely use as many as your machine can handle in parallel.
Abstractions that need to talk to each other do that by way of a unique
numerical ID chosen by the user at creation time.;
